Should be recording now. I'm having lunch. Some thoughts for the organization's posts:

What does cyber security have to do with fast fashion? If you'd ask a random person from the 2000s, all they'd say is "wen mint," but today, it's hard to imagine going out with PwnWare of a low security level on you unless you're one of those daredevil beta testers. My level 69 hat is off to them.

Imagine if software - the personal wearable fabric that people use to define their identities was still as vulnerable to cyber attacks as it was back when we used papers for money. Or was network money already a thing? I've skipped my history research for this thought stream, I know. The organization dropped some more "non-essential data" to free up a few petabytes. It was in the news.

The days of low-utility tokens are gone. How would you do your work without your software on you? People haven't evolved to handle the complexity of the modern environment bare-minded. At a bare minimum - you'd look silly and in need.

What if Pwn Fashion's software security tokenomics never took off to revolutionize app stores and development pipelines?

What if PwnWare items never became as big as they are today? Would people still be stuck using flat apps on their glowing rectangles? What a strange ape age that was. We could not envision that software could be so much more than a networked flat app.

Imagine if you had no ownership rights to the code executing in your body today. It's a sad, dystopian alternative reality that we avoided thanks to the hard work of organizations like Pwn Fashion. Our users can enjoy provably secure digital garments without caring about what the newest hack on the streets is.

We can work, play, and live relatively peacefully within our smart city communities, change how we look and feel to our peers at a moment's notice, and augment our immediate reality to fit our workloads and goals.

We trust in the security levels of the PwnWare that's part of who we think we are. Our items will stay with our gene patterns for generations.

The Pwn Fashion hacker community is thriving thanks to all the high-profile digital items one can only dream of compromising one day.

All wearables are hackable - that's true. But how many hackers are out there to pwn a level 99 Front-End Magnifier?

Like - two? The two pretending they're a spaceship and that walls are just for plebs? They probably do it al- sh;t. Thought checker. Anyway. Not all PwnWare is created equal. Some items have been changing hands for almost as long as we've been-

Getting patched to a higher security level with every new owner. Remember when people thought it was wise to get back to-

My head really feels like donating all my pleasure tokens to the thought checker today.

While a pwned item is no longer yours, you'll forever be compensated for your loss by the network.

Pwn Fashion's security tokenomics keeps our software secure and updated with the latest fashion trends, and it will continue to do so for the journey ahead.

That's enough marketing for the day. Oh, the outro thing.

As usual, let's not forget about the collective goal of the ever-evolving software that is PwnWare: thanks to our environment prioritizing and CO2 banishing policies back on Planet Three, every freshly compromised item brings us closer to that ape life.
